# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL;


#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 


SELECT * FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

#After reviewing the datasets included in this file, I used SQL to explore the data further.

--How many songs did Olivia Rodrigo have in the Spotify Top 50? And what were the titles?
SELECT distinct artist_name, track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name='Olivia Rodrigo'
GROUP BY track_name;

-- What were the top ten songs from the Spotify Top 50? And who was the artist?
SELECT distinct track_name, artist_name, popularity FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

-- What was the average popularity, danceability and energy for each song in the Spotify Top 50?
SELECT artist_name, track_name, avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP by artist_name, track_name;
